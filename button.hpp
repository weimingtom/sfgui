 * \brief A push button
 *
 * This class represents a push button graphic item. 
 * It's certainly one of the most used graphic item, as it provides a simple way to give
 * order to an application (like yes/no buttons...).
 * It provides some signals (call some useful callbacks) like clicked, mouseHover...
